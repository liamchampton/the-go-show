## Handling JSON in Go

Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode where we'll be discussing JSON and how it's handled in Golang. Now, for those of you who may not be familiar, JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for exchanging data between servers and web applications.

So, let's dive right in! We'll start by taking a look at the basics of JSON and why it's such a popular format for exchanging data. Then, we'll move on to some hands-on coding examples where I'll show you how to encode and decode JSON data in Golang. I'll also demonstrate how to handle various data types, such as arrays, objects, and nested data structures, using the built-in package "encoding/json".

By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with JSON in Golang.
